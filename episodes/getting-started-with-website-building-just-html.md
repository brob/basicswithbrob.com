## Learning plan

We'll be creating over the course of the next few weeks, your very first website. The topic can be anything, but @brob will be creating a "Fan Site" for something he's passionate about. With a project like this, there are no real-world worries attached to it. This can allow you to have fun in your first website build and not worry about the "finished product."

### Things we'll discuss today:

* The Browser (we'll use FireFox)
* We'll use [CodePen Projects](https://codepen.io/) to write our code
* Your first HTML to show something you're passionate about on screen

### To prepare

* Sign up for a CodePen free account
* Think of your project idea. It can be anything that you can write some content about and that you are really passionate about. [In the 90s, this was a big deal](https://bryanlrobinson.com/blog/bring-fansites-back-to-the-web/). Everyone who was on the Internet of old, wrote about all sorts of things: from anime to video games, from sports figures to movie stars.
