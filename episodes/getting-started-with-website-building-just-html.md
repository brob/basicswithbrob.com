In this episode, we'll dive into the very basics of creating your very first website. We'll explore the browser, we'll use CodePen Projects for simplicity and write your first code.

## Learning plan

We'll be creating over the course of the next few weeks, your very first website. The topic can be anything, but @brob will be creating a "Fan Site" for something he's passionate about. With a project like this, there are no real-world worries attached to it. This can allow you to have fun in your first website build and not worry about the "finished product."

### Things we'll discuss today:

* The Browser (we'll use FireFox)
* We'll use [https://codepen.io/](CodePen Projects) to write our code
* Your first HTML to show something you're passionate about on screen

### To prepare

* Sign up for a CodePen free account
* Think of your project idea. It can be anything that you can write some content about and that you are really passionate about.

Everyone who was on the Internet of old, wrote about all sorts of things: from anime to video games, from sports figures to movie stars.
