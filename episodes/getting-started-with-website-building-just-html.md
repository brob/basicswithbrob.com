## Learning plan

We'll tackle creating the main tutorial from the ReactJS website. By the end of the lesson, we'll hopefully have a working tic-tac-toe game built in React

### Things we'll discuss today:

* We'll use [CodePen Projects](https://codepen.io/) to write our code
* Some modern JavaScript concepts like arrow functions and classes
* React class and React functional components
